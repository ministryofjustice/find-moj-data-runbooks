## Tools

### Communication

Our main chat platform is Slack, and this is our preferred method of communication.

Most catalogue related discussions take place in the main team channel: [#data-catalogue channel](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C03QZ776JVA).

Developers typically link PRs, discuss bugs, and pair for technical issues in the [#data-catalogue-devs channel](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C06UQ5HSR25)

Our [agile ceremonies](/documentation/ways-of-working#ceremonies) take place in Google Meet,
making use of Miro boards for collecting feedback from the team,
or looking at the [team github projects board](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/projects/57/views/6) for planning.

Our main Slack channels are:

#### #data-catalogue

The [#data-catalogue](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C04M8224WCV) channel is our team channel,
where we have discussions about anything ranging from:

- technical issues
- user centered design
- questions or discussions around the service
- to request someone else from the team's help
- support rota notifications
- when we're away for lunch or some other appointment
- general musings

If you can't make standup, post your standup update here.
