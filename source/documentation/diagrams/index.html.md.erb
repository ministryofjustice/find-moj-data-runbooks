## C4 Level 2 diagram for the data catalogue

In the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/), the four C's represent [context](https://c4model.com/#SystemContextDiagram), [containers](https://c4model.com/#ContainerDiagram), [components](https://c4model.com/#ComponentDiagram), and [code](https://c4model.com/#CodeDiagram). These different levels help tell the right story, to the right audience.
