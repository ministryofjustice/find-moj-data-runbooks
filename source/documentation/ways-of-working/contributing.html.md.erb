## GitHub Practices

- We use GitHub for managing code, documentation, and support.
- We use GitHub Projects for tracking work and GitHub pull requests for reviewing and merging code.
- When working in our repos, please adhere to GitHub housekeeping guidelines when creating pull requests,
ensuring clear titles and descriptions, linking to issues when applicable,
and requesting reviews upon readiness

### GitHub Housekeeping

- When creating a pull request, ensure you have a clear title and description.
- If applicable, link your pull request to an issue with the special keywords such as
`closes`, `fixes` or `resolves` [GitHub documentation for linking pull requests to issues](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).
- If your pull request is not ready for review, convert it to a draft.
- When your pull request is ready for review, remove the draft status and ensure all checks are passing.
- When all checks are passing post the link to the PR into the [# data-catalogue-devs](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C06UQ5HSR25) channel to request a review
