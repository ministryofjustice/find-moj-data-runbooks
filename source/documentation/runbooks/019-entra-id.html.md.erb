# <%= current_page.data.title %>

Access to Find MoJ Data and the DataHub UI is controlled by Entra ID. Application / client secrets are controlled as documented in [secrets management](./014-secrets-management.html). Entra ID was previously known as "Azure AD", so note that the relevant variables are prefixed with the legacy `AZURE_` name, and that code will also contain references to "Azure".

Developers cannot create or manage application registrations in Entra Portal. Please follow the instructions in the tech services guidance pages for more information on how this can be done:

[Self-Serve Application Registration - End User Compute Services - Identity & Access Management End User Guidance](https://user-guide.staff-identity.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/guidance/selfserveappreg.html).

The Python library used to implement authentication in FMD is [django-azure-auth](https://pypi.org/project/django-azure-auth/). DataHub has [native support](https://docs.datahub.com/docs/authentication/guides/sso/configure-oidc-react) for OIDC auth.
