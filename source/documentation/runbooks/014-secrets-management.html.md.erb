## 1password
We use 1password to share secrets within the team and setup local development environments.

There is one vault for Find MoJ data, and one vault for Datahub.

There are a number of 1password utilities available to manage credentials from cli and desktop environments.

1. Install the 1Password desktop app - <https://support.1password.com/get-the-apps/>
2. Install the 1Password CLI app - <https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/>
3. Follow the steps to turn on and test the 1password desktop app integration

## Github Actions secrets
Our deployment pipelines and CI rely on [secrets in Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).

These secrets can be updated by anyone with maintainer access to the repo. Once set, they cannot be viewed again.

## Application secrets
At runtime, applications read secrets from Kubernetes.

Secrets in a namespace can be listed with

```
kubectl -n data-platform-datahub-catalogue-dev get secret
```

or viewed with

```
kubectl -n data-platform-datahub-catalogue-dev get secret $secretname -o yaml
```

See [Managing Secrets using kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configmap-secret/managing-secret-using-kubectl/).

We are not using AWS Secrets Manager as an external secretstore due to [limitations of AWS console access in Cloud Platform](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/getting-started/accessing-the-cloud-console.html#aws).
