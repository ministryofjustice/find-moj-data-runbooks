Our Datahub deployment stores metadata in two places: PostgreSQL and OpenSearch.

If the two become out of sync, we may see inconsistencies in Datahub and Find MoJ data, for example:

- containers may appear empty, even though they should contain datasets
- search results may be missing some entities
- filtering on a tag doesn't bring back everything with that tag

If this happens, [follow these instructions to restore OpenSearch indices](https://datahubproject.io/docs/how/restore-indices/#kubernetes).

Before starting the `datahub-datahub-restore-indices-job-template` cron job, amend the configuration to use the following arguments:

```
  - -a
  - batchSize=800
  - -a
  - urnBasedPagination=true
```

This reduces the default `batchSize` to avoid running out of memory on dev and enables `urnBasedPagination` for performance (see [RestoreIndices argument reference](https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/blob/master/docker/datahub-upgrade/README.md))


You can optionally include a `urn` or `urnLike` argument to restrict the reindex to specific entities, e.g.

```
  - -a
  - batchSize=800
  - -a
  - urnBasedPagination=true
  - -a
  - urnLike=urn:li:dataset:(urn:li:dataPlatform:dbt,cadet%
```


## Troubleshooting

- [Datahub v0.14.1 has a bug if URN pagination is enabled](https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/pull/11443), which prevents the job from terminating. You can monitor the job in k9s and manually kill it when it has completed. This should be fixed in the next release.
