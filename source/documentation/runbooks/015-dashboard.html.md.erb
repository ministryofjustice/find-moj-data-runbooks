The metadata dashboard is used internally within the team to track completeness of the metadata shown in Find MoJ data. It's implemented in [AWS QuickSight](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/welcome.html).

To see it, log into the [Analytical Platform Control Panel](https://controlpanel.services.analytical-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/) and
click on QuickSight.

Under Dashboards, select "FMD Dashboard v1.4" (or the latest version).

To edit the dashboard, click on "Find MoJ data dashboards" within the Analyses section.

## Add a new user

3. Add the new user
4. Ask the Analytical Platform team (#analytical-platform) to enable the access. They will need to run a script before the QuickSight link becomes available.

To allow editing:

## Data connectivity

The dashboard fetches its data from preprod Datahub's RDS database, using the `quicksight` user.

Quicksight is part of the `platforms-production` VPC, which can resolve Cloud Platform internal hostnames.

Credentials for the `quicksight` user can be found in the "Datahub" 1Password vault.

If you need to recreate the credentials, [connect to the database](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/other-topics/rds-external-access.html) and run the following,
replacing `<password>` with a randomly generated password:

```sql
-- workaround for Quicksight using outdated database drivers
set password_encryption = 'md5';
create user quicksight with password '<password>';
grant connect on database db67fea2022376ec46 to quicksight;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO quicksight;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO quicksight;
```
