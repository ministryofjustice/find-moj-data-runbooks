The metadata dashboard is a proof-of-concept used to track completeness of the metadata shown in Find MoJ Data. It's implemented in [AWS QuickSight](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/welcome.html).

The recommended way to access the dashboard is to click the [Metadata dashboard](https://find-moj-data.service.justice.gov.uk/dashboard/) link in the footer of any page within Find MoJ Data.

## View or edit the dashboard via the Analytical Platform

You may have also have access to the dashboard as an Analytical Platform user. Log into the [Analytical Platform Control Panel](https://controlpanel.services.analytical-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/) and click on QuickSight. If you do not see this in the main navigation, click on your username at the top-right of the page and use the self-serve options to grant yuorself access.

Under Dashboards, select "FMD Dashboard v1.4" (or the latest version).

To edit the dashboard, click on "Find MoJ Data dashboards" within the Analyses section.

### To share the dashboard

1. Open the dashboard
2. Click the "Share" icon in the top right

### To allow editing

1. Open the analysis
2. Click on "Share" within the file menu

## Data connectivity

The dashboard fetches its data from preprod DataHub's RDS database, using the `quicksight` user.

Quicksight is part of the `platforms-production` VPC, which can resolve Cloud Platform internal hostnames.

Credentials for the `quicksight` user can be found in the "DataHub" 1Password vault.

If you need to recreate the credentials, [connect to the database](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/other-topics/rds-external-access.html) and run the following,
replacing `<password>` with a randomly generated password:

```sql
-- workaround for Quicksight using outdated database drivers
set password_encryption = 'md5';
create user quicksight with password '<password>';
grant connect on database db67fea2022376ec46 to quicksight;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO quicksight;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO quicksight;
```
