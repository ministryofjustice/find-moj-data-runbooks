Metadata can be validated in multiple places:

1. As part of the system the metadata comes from, e.g. dbt, glue
2. By Datahub and the ingestion sources/transformers
3. By Find MoJ data itself, before displaying an entry back to the user

Our general strategy for dealing with low quality metadata is to ingest it into Datahub if we can, so it can be reported
on. However, we do some extra checking in Find MoJ data, and sometimes show users an error instead of showing a page with
invalid metadata.

The full list of metadata fields used by Find MoJ data is documented in our [Metadata specification](https://find-moj-data.service.justice.gov.uk//metadata_specification).

## Core text fields
Text fields include the name, description, and the display name (`dc_readable_name`).

Descriptions may contain valid [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

Other text fields can only contain plain text. Markdown or HTML is not supported.

## Datetime fields
When we ingest into Datahub we keep track of the last ingested time, and where possible determine the date the data itself was created and last modified
from the ingestion source. Find MoJ data validates that none of these dates are in the future. 

## Contact information
- Slack/Teams metadata consists of a URL plus a channel name (e.g. `dc_slack_channel_name`, `dc_slack_channel_url`). This is expected to include the leading '#' (but this is not enforced).
- Find MoJ data validates email addresses are valid using the Pydantic [EmailStr](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/networks/#pydantic.networks.EmailStr) type.

## Table schemas
- Schemas are automatically ingested from the source system so this metadata is not expected to be manually changed.
- Although Datahub maps platform-specific data types to standardised ones, Find MoJ data will show the type as it is reported by the ingestion source.
- Column descriptions are expected to be plain text - Markdown is not supported.

## Access information
`dc_access_requirements` can either be a URL, or plain text. Markdown or HTML is not supported.

The following properties are not yet validated anywhere, but should be set to one of the valid values:

- `dc_where_to_access` is either `AnalyticalPlatform` or blank.
- `audience` is either `Internal` or `Published`. The default is `Internal`.
