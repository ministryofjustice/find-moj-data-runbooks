A [DataHub status dashboard](https://grafana.live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/d/RCuKtmqAFFtTd5MXzxp4/datahub-dashboard?orgId=1&from=now-2d&to=now) has been created to provide an overview of the recent (up to the last 48 hours) performance of the the DataHub instances.

This dashboard shows the number of queries across the GMS and frontend of the service, and the latency of these operations. The [dashboard readme](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/data-catalogue/tree/main/helm_deploy/monitoring/README.md) has links to explanations and code definitions of the specific metrics being pulled from Prometheus.
