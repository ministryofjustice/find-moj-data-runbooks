# <%= current_page.data.title %>

There is no prescribed cadence for updates to DataHub, but new minor versions bumps are typically released every couple of months.
Due to the rapid pace of feature development within the platform
we aim to be close to the most recent release (without unnecessary exposure to unintended breaking changes).

The upgrade process for DataHub is relatively straightforward as it is handled by a [dedicated upgrade job](https://github.com/acryldata/datahub-helm/tree/master/charts/datahub/templates/datahub-upgrade):

1. Check the [DataHub 'Updating DataHub' page for breaking changes](https://datahubproject.io/docs/how/updating-datahub#breaking-changes)
1. Check the DataHub helm releases to
[check for the latest release that's compatible with the destination version](https://github.com/acryldata/datahub-helm/blame/master/charts/datahub/Chart.yaml#L10)
1. Check the [DataHub helm release changes from current deployed version to future version](https://github.com/acryldata/datahub-helm/compare/datahub-0.3.30...datahub-0.4.6)
for any changes that need to be propagated to the helm chart values files
(make sure to set the 'base' and 'compare' to the correct release values in this view)
1. Submit the upgrade release PR and send an 'alert' message to the [#data-catalogue-dev](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C06UQ5HSR25) channel to let others know that DataHub may be disrupted
1. Deploy to dev and test out the [DataHub interface](https://datahub-catalogue-dev.apps.live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/),
ensure that [Find MoJ Data dev](https://data-platform-find-moj-data-dev.apps.live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/)
continues to function ([run a test deployment](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/find-moj-data/actions/workflows/test-and-deploy.yml))
    * Make sure to test out multiple pages of Find MoJ Data, as we've found that previously described changes not considered to be breaking have broken our front end.
1. If there are issues with the upgrade and compatibility with Find MoJ Data, work with the team to determine the best course of action for upgrade, which may involve a temporary rollback.
1. Once there are no issues with the upgrade, merge the PR and roll out the upgrade to higher environments.
