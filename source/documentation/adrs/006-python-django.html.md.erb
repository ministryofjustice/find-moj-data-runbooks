## Status

âœ… Accepted

## Context

Given the decision to layer our own interface over DataHub, this ADR is concerned with the choice of development stack for that application.

## Analysis

There are a number of tech stacks in use in Justice Digital, including:

* Ruby / Ruby on Rails
* PHP
* Python
* .NET

Should the front-end application require its own data store, the following database management systems are available:

* Oracle
* PostgreSQL
* MS SQL Server

Python is a well supported language within Justice Digital, and a common language for those involved with data. Python is the language used by DataHub.

Django is a popular, well documented development framework for Python web applications with good community support and regular updates.

PostgreSQL is much lower cost than the alternatives and has first-class support within our Cloud Platform.

## Decision

We will use Python as the development language, Django as the web application framework, and PostgreSQL as a data store.

## Consequences

* The Data Catalogue team will need to ensure that the appropriate skills are in place to maintain the application
* The team will need to ensure database resources are appropriately provisioned, and that backup and disaster reocvery processes are in place
