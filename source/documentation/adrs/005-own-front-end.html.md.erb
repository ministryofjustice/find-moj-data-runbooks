## Status

âœ… Accepted

## Context

This ADR is concerned with the choice of how we present the catalogue to our users.

## Analysis

There are two options:

* We roll out DataHub's default interface to users
* We utilise the DataHub API to create our own front-end

Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages:

### Use DataHub's default interface

#### Advantages

* No additional development required

#### Disadvantages

* The DataHub UI was proven through user research to be overwhelmingly complicated for some users
* The DataHub UI fails on a number of accessibility criteria
* The DataHub UI exposes *all* functionality, whether it is currently in use or not, and whether our data improvement programme and overall data maturity is ready for a feature

### Create our own front-end (user interface)

#### Advantages

* We can leverage the GOV.UK design system to present a trusted, familiar interface
* We can create our own identity (brand)
* We have control over accessibility
* We can expose features as and when users and the organisation is ready
* We can make our code open so that other departments can re-use it

#### Disadvantages

* Greater development resource required

## Decision

Given the disadvantages of the DataHub UI and the advantages of a GOV.UK interface, the decsion is to create our own front end.

## Consequences

The Data Catalogue team will need to:

* Understand the development stack, including the Design System
* Be aware of how to develop accessible features
* Create and maintain Cloud Platform environments for the front-end application
* Integrate Entra ID into the application
* Deploy the application
* Secure the application
* Monitor performance
* Check for and apply patches and other updates
* Test new features in a realistic non-production environments
