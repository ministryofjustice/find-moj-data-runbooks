## Status

✅ Accepted

## Context

The Data Catalogue services will need a way to verify users and provide access to resources.
We want to simplify access for users by reducing the number of accounts they need.

We do not want to create a custom identity service, or manage a very large number of users with a separate DataHub identity.

We do want users to be identified when interacting with the Find MOJ Data front end.

## Decision

We will use the existing in-house [EntraID](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id) (formally Azure Active Directory) service for [Identity and Access Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management) (IDAM), both for DataHub and Find MOJ Data.

Many of our users are already using a `@justice.gov.uk` account as their primary login.

Our users can take advantage of their existing identity to gain access to the Data Catalogue.

## Consequences

- We will not have to run an identity service and managing logging and security of that system
- We will reduce or eliminate our support requirements for:
  - joiners, movers and leavers (JML)
  - issues with multi factor authentication and password resets
  - name changes (e.g. marriage)
- Guest accounts are possible, but not managed which means we will need an alternative solution
- As there is no systematic way to create and manage EntraID groups to provide authorisation, we may need to rely on DataHub roles for this
- We will no longer need to use IP range restrictions for the services
- We will need to exclude the `/metrics` endpoint from authentication, but also secure it from public access
