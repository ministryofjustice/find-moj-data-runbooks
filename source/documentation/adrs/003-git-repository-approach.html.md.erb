## Status

âœ… Accepted

## Context

There was a discussion around what is the best git repo stategy to accomodate the following:

- Find MOJ Data App
- Python Datahub library
- Data registration API (still being discussed)

 [This diagram](../../images/repo-strategy-workflow.excalidraw.png) highlights the differences between using one repo per component or a single repo for all

## Decision

The following was agreed:

- Use a mono repo approach for the components above.
- The App and possible APIs should import the python library via relative path.
- The library will still be packaged and uploaded to PYPI to allow external users
