## Status

âœ… Accepted

## Context

Some catalogue products offer a feature which allows a user to view a sample of data, and during user research a small number of users have noted that data previews would be useful.

## Analysis

### Advantages

* A user can get a better sense of what a dataset contains if they can preview or download some data directly from a catalogue

### Disdvantages

* This creates a "shadow copy" of data outside of whatever governance requirements are places upon it, for example retention
* This potentially bypasses any access control rules in place for data
* Storing data substantially increases the risk surface area for the catalogue
* This creates an additional burden on already legnthy metadata ingestion to fetch and refresh data

## Decision

We will **not** store data in the catalogue for preview or other purposes. The catalogue will only contain metadata.
