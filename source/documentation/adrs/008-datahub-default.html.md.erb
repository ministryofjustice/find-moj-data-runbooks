## Status

âœ… Accepted

## Context

Since DataHub is open source, and we host it ourselves, we have the ability to make changes to its functionality by altering its code.

We also have the ability to configure DataHub (via settings / configuration files) with the constraints of what DataHub offers.

## Analysis

### Advantages

* We can tailor DataHub to meet specific organisational requirements

### Disdvantages

* Changes to code will make deploying future upgrades much more difficult, creating a barrier to deploying patches and new features

## Decision

We will **not** alter DataHub's code, and instead limit any customisation to what can be achieved through standard configuration.
